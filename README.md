# kuponmatik  
a small program that bets to random matches.  
this program uses node.js and puppeteer for fetching matches from nesine.com - a turkish betting site - and records it as json in data.json.  
after that, we parse the data and create a coupon with python.  

just change the path of your node.js executable in app.py and run it.
